## inspired by Avery Alder's *The Quiet Year*

It is spring, and your community has just weathered a devastating winter. Now, to rebuild.

*it's getting colder* is a text-based clicker with a timeline. You have one year to build and assemble resources to prepare for the winter to come. When it arrives, the game will notify you of whether you have survived.

### Technologies
*it's getting colder* utilizes HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript to handle interactions and logic. The primary method of interacting will be through a series of buttons. The game will also include an HTML canvas, which displays your burgeoning community.

Layout is handed with CSS Grid.
