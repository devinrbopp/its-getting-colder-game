# *it's getting colder*
## inspired by Avery Alder's *The Quiet Year*

It is spring, and your community has just weathered a devastating winter. Now, to rebuild.

it's getting colder is a text-based clicker with a timeline. You have one year to build and assemble resources to prepare for the winter to come. When it arrives, randomly generated conditions will determine whether you have survived.

### Technologies
*it's getting colder* utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript to handle interactions and logic. The primary method of interacting will be through a series of buttons. The game will also include an HTML canvas, which displays your burgeoning community.

### Wireframes



### MVP Goals
* a year of gameplay, consisting of three 'events' per season
* branching story events, based on player decisions during each event
* a system of iterators that generate resources based on the contents of the community
* a basic HTML canvas that displays the contents of the village
* randomly generated win conditions upon reaching the end of the timeline
* snow animation on canvas

### Stretch Goals
* basic 'physics' for the canvas, so that items drop in from the top
* longer seasons, perhaps with the option to select the number of events for season
